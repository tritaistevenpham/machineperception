Hello, this is my submission for Machine Perception's 2018 Assignment.
All images that are to be tested must be stored in "Images/SetB" located inside this file.
There was another file, called Debug that has all the images written for testing purposes,
but all content has been removed for this submission.

To run the submission, all you have to do is enter "$ python MPAssignment.py"
Please note this assumes that all of the images inside SetB are still of .JPG format.

I have inserted 2 selections for the program, the first option is purely for debugging and
testing purposes. The second option is what I would like you to run the assignment demo with.

    Select "1": Reads only 1 image in the current working directory
    Select "2": Reads all images inside the Images/SetB/ directory
    
Please enjoy :)

--Steven.
